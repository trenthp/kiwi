## What
This is meant to be a trial run for optimization. There are a few techniques used here to have a run-through on what can be done really quickly to optimize a site. Most every idea comes from Chris Coyier's guide http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/114-lets-do-simple-stuff-to-make-our-websites-faster/

## How
Following the tips given by Chris, and then finding a few other resources, optimization was made fairly easily. Here are a few links to help. 
This is to setup the .htaccess file for gzipping and expiring headers.

Optimize Images

Minify CSS

## Results
Things are looking pretty good. Lots of smaller file sizes. I will be adding some screen shots of the before and after (although I did not get the very before, only part way into it. There is still a huge difference.)
